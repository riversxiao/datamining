![stroop effect](http://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.q5oU_sPl8KBfwm0eEmDkMAEsEV&pid=15.1)

In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 

I'll create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task and then will look at some data collected from others who 
have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. 
Finally, I will interpret the results in terms of my hypotheses.



This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

> How to identify components of an experiment
> How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
> How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

## Stroop Effect explanation

The Stroop effect is a demonstration of the phenomenon that the brain's reaction time slows down when it has to deal with conflicting information. 
This slowed reaction time happens because of interference, or a processing delay caused by competing or incompatible functions in the brain. 
The effect became widely known after John Ridley Stroop, an American psychologist, published a paper on it in 1935, but it had been studied by several other researchers before Stroop.

This phenomenon is typically studied with a Stroop test. 
In this test, a researcher times how long it takes a test taker to say the name of a color printed in gray or black ink. 
For instance, the person would see the word "blue" printed and then say "blue." 
The researcher then shows the test taker color names printed in another color — 
like the word "green" printed in orange ink — and times how long it takes the test 
taker to say the color that the word is printed in. Most people are much slower and are more likely to 
make mistakes during the second task than the first one since the second one presents the brain with conflicting information.
Stroop's original test was a little different, but many modern Stroop tests are structured in this way.
