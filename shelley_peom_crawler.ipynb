    "Recently,a movie called \"alien covenant\" caught a lot of people's eye. Just as a reviewer puts it-sci-fi meets classic literature in 'Alien: Covenant', this sci-fi film mixed itself with multiple classical literature elements to distinguish itself from other sci-fi films. \n",
    "\n",
    "These literature elements brought the film some aroma of exotic spices and impressed me a lot. And the one intrigues me most comes from the scence where the robot David cited a Shelley's poem --\"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair\". Though , David didn't mention that he want to become the king of the king, what he did was self-evident. \n",
    "\n",
    "While David praises Shelley's poem as remarkable, I am somewhat puzzled. If David was so creative,at least he himself thought so, Shouldn't he produce an original masterpiece by himself rather than recite Shelley's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this is something deep learning can exzactly do, without further ado, let's make an AI to do just that-- create a new Shelley's style poem. Even the AI I created is not as powerfull as David,at least, it creates a poem better than he can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the plan I come about\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I need to get all the poems written by Shelley.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I'll use the RNN Neural Network with LSTM to train the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with saved parameters, I can create as many poems as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I crawled all Shelley's peoms from a website. The website contains 327 poems written by Shelley and the crawling process went smoothly. In a few minutes , all poems were downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to do is to use a RNN architecture to train the AI. the training process also went smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a piece of poem written by AI, see, it wasn't that bad after all, at least, it surpasses mine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "then, \n",
    "fraud then thou, \n",
    "but more dear to life, \n",
    "as from the spirit's wilderness, \n",
    "the thick which thou withered, \n",
    "for the song, \n",
    "when the moon is awakened, \n",
    "the flood is buried, \n",
    "but gentle gentle was slumber thus in her grave. \n",
    "there is a reward of clouds, and the swallow the water fell. \n",
    "the coursers springs of the soul it was too. \n",
    "then shrinks back, and i cry about to know that others fall, \n",
    "knows by looks, \n",
    "we moulded in mountains. \n",
    "but like shadow after friends and filled with thine own sway;-- from the earthâ€™s waves are shaken, \n",
    "the nations & sorrows not the speed of bacchus, \n",
    "in the blood of the ocean cling, \n",
    "with living green and black both. though far bringing, and when i feeble, i think i arose the night the eyes, like wrecks, \n",
    "in the surge of heaven, where high once lighted green the red shades down in clear up in the place of the unfathomable ocean, \n",
    "night in the eden of one fair dew, \n",
    "two by pain\n"
