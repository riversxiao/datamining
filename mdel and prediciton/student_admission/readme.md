## student admission model

-------

this is a simple multilayer neural network model. Given grade and GRE score of a student , the model will predict whether 
this person will get admitted or not. 

Through this simple model, I want to see how different parameters would affect the performance of the model

Here are some questions and answers I come up with.

1. Which one to choose and why: ACE or MSE ?

2. Which optimizer to choose and why: Adam, Ada, or others
