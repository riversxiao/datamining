In this project, I'm creating different python code to handle different 
aspect of data analysis

1. webscaper for get data from various data source

2. datacleaning for preprocessing the data

3. datastoring for importing data excute sql and export data for further analysis

4. datamanipulation for performing data analysis using tools like numpy pandas or dplyr in R

5. datavisualization for presenting data to audience including ggplot2, matplotlib, D3, tableau


This is a continuous project that need further refine and maintain, I'll keep updating the content
