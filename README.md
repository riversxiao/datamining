I'm currently working in an online payment company handling various risky transactions. As a risk analyst,I find it  import to know the story behind the data so that i can avoid myself being blinded by data,neverthless, it's equally important  
to sharp data analytic skills to get to deal with risky transactions. 

In order to sharp my data analytic skills, I'm creating this repo to record my learning endeavour. 

I divided the learning paths into the following five categories

1. webscaper for get data from various data source

2. datacleaning for preprocessing the data

3. datastoring for importing data excute sql and export data for further analysis

4. datamanipulation for performing data analysis using tools like numpy pandas or dplyr in R

5. datavisualization for presenting data to audience including ggplot2, matplotlib, D3, tableau


This is a continuous project that need further refine and maintain, I'll keep updating the content
