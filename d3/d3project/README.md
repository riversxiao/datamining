## This is D3 Visualization Project

## Summary

In This Project, I want to use data visualization to display the survival rate between sex. From it, I wish to clearly demonstrate the different survival rate between sex in order to support the "women first" claim.

## Design

The chart contains several dropdown options describing the following situations

1. All Survival Rate : This dropdown chart visualize the survived people vs died people

2. Male Survival Age Distribtution : This dropdown chart describe the number of survived men vs died men

3. Female Survival Rate : This dropdown chart describe the number of survived women vs died women

The reason I choosed the pie chart is as follows: whether it be a bar chart or a pie chart, they can all clearly show the age distribution among different groups. However, In this specific dataset, there is a clear comparison between charts that men sacrifice their lives for women. So I thought Pie chart will be more effective in showing the trend.

## Feedback

There are a few things to be noted in this project

I asked a few friends for their advice and here are some advice given by them

comments from friend 1

> The page background is grey, maybe add some background picture could make the page more attractive

> the bar colors are using blue and green, so changing it to red maybe more approperiate.


comments from friend 2

> Suggest me add a titanic picture on the title and change the title font color from black to white

> There are too many text in the aside the graph, I should exclude some of them to standout the main theme.

comments from friend 3

> add some descriptive words to help us better understanding the meaning of the photo

> not much information can be revealed from the visualization

comments from reviewer

> the original chart which displays survived people numbers among different ages, that clearly does not show the main theme that ' man sacrifice their lives for women'


So I took their advices and made some changes to my webpage.
I was thinking of getting children survival rate, but it's hard to decide what age should be categorized as children in the first place, in addition, due to immature of the children, they would be sure to have a much lower survival rate compared with adults, so I didn't draw the children pie chart.

Note:Since I'm not a seasoned HTML/JavaScript/CSS user,a lot of my Javascript code comes from the book "Expert Data Visualization" written by Jos Dirksen, I also searched the framework of HTML and CSS from w3schools to draw the structure of the webpage.
